# Anagram_Sorter
This program takes an input of anagrams and then sorts them with anagrams of the word bunched together<br>
It also sorts the anagrams alphabetically.<br/>
This program is wildly inefficient since it uses a bunch of nested for-loops<br/>
This program is one of my more sloppy programs due to me being in a hurry and thinking of the quickest way to solve the problem<br/>
instead of solving it the most efficienct way</br>
